Hey everyone, in this video demonstration, we're diving into software installation within a Linux environment. To start, we'll create a text file named 'Jagilmor Cyber.txt' to confirm this recording. We'll kick off with the APT command, showcasing the APT package manager. Next up, we'll install 'Suricata' using 'sudo apt install Suricata'â€”bear in mind, this installation will take some time as it downloads and installs the required libraries. Ensure to confirm with a 'Yes' to proceed.

Once 'Suricata' is installed, let's explore its commands by accessing it through the command prompt with 'suricata.' Take a moment to acquaint yourself with its functionalities. Then, we'll swiftly move to demonstrate the removal of a Linux application using the 'sudo apt remove CAA' command. Confirm with 'Yes' ('Y') when prompted. The removal process is typically faster than the installation.

Following this, we'll install another application, 'TCP dump,' quickly using 'sudo apt install tcpdump.' Once installed, we'll verify the list of installed applications with 'apt list --installed,' where 'TCP dump' will stand out.

To wrap up, we'll reinstall 'Suricata' with 'sudo apt install Suricata.' Confirm with 'Yes' as before. After the installation, we'll double-check the list of installed applications to confirm 'Suricata's' presence.
